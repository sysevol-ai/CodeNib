# Paper Artifact Workflow

The paper artifact has two ownership layers:

1. `codeminer.eval.artifact_bundle` is general release infrastructure. It can
   be reviewed and merged into `main` independently of the paper.
2. `docs/experiments/artifacts/paper_artifact/` freezes the paper-specific
   datasets, result trees, plotting sources, and release documentation. This
   directory belongs on the publication artifact branch until artifact
   evaluation begins.

Large experiment outputs are inputs, not source code. They may live on a local
disk, object store, or downloaded release, but no mount point is encoded in the
manifest. The manifest refers only to named roots and relative paths. A source
lock records the canonical file count, byte count, and path-sensitive SHA-256
identity of every selected tree.

## Prepare Dataset Roots

Freeze the two public datasets at the revisions used by the paper. The output
directories can be anywhere outside the repository.

```bash
hf download fishmingyu/codeminer-base-dataset \
  data/test-00000-of-00001.parquet \
  --repo-type dataset \
  --revision 4eb84e2e8918474969ce68c5b06facf14d6be604 \
  --local-dir "$BASE_DATASET_ROOT"

hf download sysevol-ai/codeminer-synthesis \
  --repo-type dataset \
  --revision 5ac36c39ef69bbfe2e14dac58b6067b8c350c53e \
  --include '.gitattributes' 'README.md' 'quality_report.json' \
    '*/test-00000-of-00001.parquet' \
  --local-dir "$SYNTHESIS_DATASET_ROOT"
```

`$CODEMINER_EXPERIMENT_ROOT` is the root containing `profile_log/`,
`eval_results/`, and the selected directories under `results/`.
`$CODEMINER_FIGURE_ROOT` is the `codeminer-figure` checkout in cm-draw. These
paths are runtime bindings and must not be committed.

## Lock Sources

Regenerate the lock only when intentionally changing a reported input or a
plotting source. Review the lock diff before building a release.

```bash
python -m codeminer.eval.artifact_bundle lock \
  --manifest docs/experiments/artifacts/paper_artifact/bundle-manifest.json \
  --root code="$PWD" \
  --root data="$CODEMINER_EXPERIMENT_ROOT" \
  --root figures="$CODEMINER_FIGURE_ROOT" \
  --root base_dataset="$BASE_DATASET_ROOT" \
  --root synthesis_dataset="$SYNTHESIS_DATASET_ROOT" \
  --output /tmp/paper-artifact-source-lock.json
```

Compare the generated lock with
`docs/experiments/artifacts/paper_artifact/source-lock.json`. A mismatch means
the selected evidence changed; do not bypass it by building without a lock.

The synthesis Hub snapshot retains a historical `README.md` that describes an
earlier 280-row state. The artifact-level README identifies the five 100-row
parquets and `quality_report.json` as the canonical paper selection while
preserving the source README unchanged for provenance.

## Build And Verify

Build outside the source and input trees. The builder refuses an existing
output directory, stages atomically, rejects symbolic links, verifies every
locked source, and records every bundled file in `SHA256SUMS`.

```bash
python -m codeminer.eval.artifact_bundle build \
  --manifest docs/experiments/artifacts/paper_artifact/bundle-manifest.json \
  --source-lock docs/experiments/artifacts/paper_artifact/source-lock.json \
  --root code="$PWD" \
  --root data="$CODEMINER_EXPERIMENT_ROOT" \
  --root figures="$CODEMINER_FIGURE_ROOT" \
  --root base_dataset="$BASE_DATASET_ROOT" \
  --root synthesis_dataset="$SYNTHESIS_DATASET_ROOT" \
  --output "$ARTIFACT_BUILD_ROOT/codeminer-paper-artifact"

python -m codeminer.eval.artifact_bundle verify \
  --bundle "$ARTIFACT_BUILD_ROOT/codeminer-paper-artifact"
```

Then run the figure reproduction and semantic verifier from the bundle root.
Write generated files outside the bundle so its complete checksum inventory
remains valid:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r figure/requirements-paper.txt
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python figure/reproduce_paper_figures.py \
  --config paper_artifact_config.json \
  --output-dir "$REPRODUCED_FIGURE_ROOT"
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python figure/verify_paper_figures.py \
  --expected-dir verification/expected \
  --actual-dir "$REPRODUCED_FIGURE_ROOT"

python -m codeminer.eval.artifact_bundle archive \
  --bundle "$ARTIFACT_BUILD_ROOT/codeminer-paper-artifact" \
  --output "$ARTIFACT_BUILD_ROOT/codeminer-paper-artifact.tar.gz"
```

The core artifact intentionally excludes materialized vector, graph, BM25, and
LSP caches. They are large, source-linked, and not read by a reported estimator
or plotting program. The retained lifecycle reports still expose setup,
hydration, query, resource, and failure measurements. An optional cache archive
can be published separately, with its own license review and checksum.
